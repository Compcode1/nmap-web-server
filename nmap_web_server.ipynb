    "\n",
    "This project successfully demonstrated **network scanning, web server enumeration, and security analysis** using **Nmap** and a **Python-based HTTP server**. Through a structured series of steps, we explored how Nmap detects network services, tracks changes, and identifies potential security misconfigurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **üîç Key Findings & Takeaways**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **‚úÖ 1. Nmap for Network Scanning & Service Detection**\n",
    "- **Baseline scan:** Before starting the web server, we used `nmap -sV` to establish which network services were already running.\n",
    "- **Detecting an active web server:** After launching a Python HTTP server, we confirmed its presence on **port 8000** using Nmap.\n",
    "- **Tracking changes:** When we later changed the port to **8080**, Nmap scans revealed how service detection is affected by port modifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **‚úÖ 2. Web Content Enumeration & Security Risks**\n",
    "- **Used `http-enum` to identify exposed files and directories.**\n",
    "- **Verified that files and directories were publicly accessible** if no access restrictions were in place.\n",
    "- **Key finding:** The web server initially exposed unintended directories due to improper configuration. This was later corrected by explicitly setting a restricted directory (`~/WebServerTest`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **‚úÖ 3. Modifying the Web Server & Observing Impact**\n",
    "- **Port modification:** We changed the web server port from **8000 to 8080** and observed how it affected visibility in Nmap scans.\n",
    "- **Root directory modification:** Initially, the server **unintentionally served the entire home directory**, exposing personal files.\n",
    "- **Security fix:** We **explicitly set a dedicated directory (`~/WebServerTest`)** to prevent unintended exposure. Nmap scans confirmed that previously exposed directories were no longer visible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **‚úÖ 4. Stopping the Web Server & Validating Removal**\n",
    "- **Killed the running web server process.**\n",
    "- **Confirmed with Nmap that port 8080 was now closed**, proving the server was no longer active.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **üéØ Lessons Learned**\n",
    "- **Nmap is a powerful tool** for detecting open ports, running services, and identifying potential misconfigurations.\n",
    "- **Improperly configured web servers can expose unintended files**, making security scanning essential.\n",
    "- **Restricting the web server‚Äôs root directory** is a simple but critical security measure.\n",
    "- **Monitoring open ports over time** helps track potential unauthorized changes or exposures.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project provided a hands-on experience in **real-world network security monitoring**, demonstrating how even a simple web server can introduce security risks if not properly configured.\n"
